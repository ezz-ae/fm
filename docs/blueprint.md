# UNWRITTEN Blueprint: The User's Journey

This document outlines the user's journey through the UNWRITTEN experience, from the initial moment of arrival to the emergence of the AI "Notebook."

## 1. The Arrival: A Void of Expectation

*   The user lands on a page that is intentionally empty, dark, and silent. There is no UI, no logo, no instructions. It feels still, perhaps even broken.
*   This moment of stillness is a core feature. The system waits for the user.

## 2. The First Motion: Consent and Creation

*   When the user moves their mouse, finger, or stylus, the experience begins.
*   A chalk-like line appears, following their movement. A subtle soundscape begins.
*   The user understands intuitively: "This space responds to me."

## 3. The Act of Writing: Expression Without Purpose

*   The user can write, draw, or scribble freely. There are no prompts, no goals, and no way to erase.
*   The act of writing has a physical feel, with the system responding to speed and pressure.

## 4. The Pause: A Signal of Completion

*   When the user pauses for a moment, the system interprets this as a signal that they have finished their thought.
*   The chalk sound fades, and the writing begins to subtly decay.

## 5. The Collective Field: Presence Without People

*   The user's canvas begins to slide horizontally, revealing blurred, unreadable fragments of other users' "writing."
*   This creates a sense of a shared space and collective presence, without introducing social comparison or the need for identity.

## 6. The Choice: Confidence Without Words

*   Two symbols appear: **◯ (open)** and **✕ (close)**.
*   This is a silent question: "Are you willing to let this exist beyond you?"
*   Hovering over each option provides a visual and emotional preview of the consequence (glowing vs. fading).

## 7. The Two Paths

*   **If the user chooses ✕ (Hesitation):**
    *   The scene fades. A single "**$**" symbol appears, representing a point of friction and an opportunity to try again. This is where the **PayPal integration** is triggered, framing monetization as a sign of intent.

*   **If the user chooses ◯ (Confidence):**
    *   This is the turning point. The collective field freezes, the user's writing folds inward, and a vertical line appears. The **Notebook** emerges.

## 8. The Notebook: Dialogue Without Conversation

*   The **AI (powered by Gemini and Genkit)** does not act like a chatbot. It speaks sparingly, offering brief, poetic observations about the user's patterns.
*   Examples: "I see motion." or "This pattern repeats." The AI's words appear slowly and then fade, creating a sense of a listening presence rather than a tool.

## 9. Identity: Intentionally Absent

*   At no point in this journey is the user asked for a name, email, or password. The experience is designed to be identity-free, focusing purely on expression.
