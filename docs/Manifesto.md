# UNWRITTEN Manifesto

## The Real Product is Permission

UNWRITTEN is not an app; it is a **threshold**. It is a motion-based state where expression precedes identity, and meaning emerges only through choice.

Our core principles are built on a reversal of the typical digital contract:

*   **Expression Before Identity:** We allow movement before meaning and trust before ownership. Users do not declare themselves to participate; they simply begin.
*   **Motion as Consent:** The experience begins with a user's movement. There is no "start" button, no onboarding, no instructions. The first motion is a signal of intent, and the system responds in kind.
*   **Hesitation is Respected:** Pauses are not seen as inactivity but as signals of completion or reflection. The system does not rush the user; it listens to their silence.
*   **Presence Without Comparison:** We create a sense of a "collective field"—a knowledge that others are present—without introducing profiles, metrics, or social comparison. It is connection without exposure.
*   **Choice, Not Instruction:** Critical decisions are presented as feelings or symbols (◯ vs. ✕), not as transactional UI. The user *feels* the consequence of a choice before they make it.

## What We Are Not

UNWRITTEN is deliberately **not**:

*   A productivity tool or a journaling app.
*   A publishing platform or a social feed.
*   A therapy product or a content factory.

It is a **mirror that reacts honestly**, a space that grants safety to hesitate, and a path that reveals itself only after trust is earned. We don't ask users to "create." We allow them to **arrive**.
